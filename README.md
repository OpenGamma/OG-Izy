Welcome to OpenGamma Izy!
========
The OpenGamma Izy project (OG-Izy) is intended to provide a vector oriented API to allow access to core maths functionality (like that found in system "libm", but vectorised!). The project has a reference library that implements the API and makes calls to the local native maths library. However, the backing can easily be swapped to a chip vendor specific implementation for added performance.
