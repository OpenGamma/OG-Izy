Linux/Apple build
-----------------

This assumes you have CMake 2.8 and the GNU toolchain installed:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake .. [options]
  make

This does an out-of-source build in the build subdirectory. To clean all build
files, delete the build folder. 

Windows build
-------------

Requires Cmake 2.8, Mingw32, Git bash and Gnuwin32 Make:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  ../cmake.windows .. [options]
  make

This does an out-of-source build in the build subdirectory. To clean all build
files, delete the build folder. 

Build options
-------------

  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<type>

    Either Debug or Release. Debug adds the -g flag for debugging. Release adds
    compiler optimisation flags. Not specifying the build type will result in
    none of these flags being applied.


Testing
-------

Run:

  make test

Test logs are stored in build/Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log. If you are running
on Linux, valgrind will also be run on all the tests.
