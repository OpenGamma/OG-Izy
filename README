Linux/Apple build
-----------------

This assumes you have CMake 2.8 and the GNU toolchain installed:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake .. [options]
  make

This does an out-of-source build in the build subdirectory. To clean all build
files, delete the build folder. 

Windows build
-------------

Requires Cmake 2.8, Mingw32, Git bash and Gnuwin32 Make:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  ../cmake.windows .. [options]
  make

This does an out-of-source build in the build subdirectory. To clean all build
files, delete the build folder. 

Build options
-------------

  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<type>

    Either Debug or Release. Debug adds the -g flag for debugging. Release adds
    compiler optimisation flags. Not specifying the build type will result in
    none of these flags being applied.


Testing
-------

Run:

  make test

Test logs are stored in build/Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log. If you are running
on Linux, valgrind will also be run on all the tests.

Build queues
------------

The following queues run each time a commit is pushed to master:

  http://10.0.2.48:8010/builders/izy-master-lnx-none
  http://10.0.2.48:8010/builders/izy-master-lnx-release
  http://10.0.2.48:8010/builders/izy-master-lnx-debug
  http://10.0.2.48:8010/builders/izy-master-win-none
  http://10.0.2.48:8010/builders/izy-master-win-release
  http://10.0.2.48:8010/builders/izy-master-win-debug
  http://10.0.2.48:8010/builders/izy-master-osx-none
  http://10.0.2.48:8010/builders/izy-master-osx-release
  http://10.0.2.48:8010/builders/izy-master-osx-debug

These check the None, Release, and Debug builds on Linux, Windows, and OS X,
presuming requisite build slaves are available. (The OS X and Windows slaves
are running on Graham's laptops at the moment).
